# Backend for my portfolio website
 Aim as Junior developer or someone in tech, I need to have something that can tell people about me. Also, where I can share ideas and connect with others. This is the repo for the backend of my website
# How it works
- A user creates account
- Generating a token that he will use after logging in
- After logging in you get administrative rigths of manipulating the blogs, eg: deleting, creating, updating a blog
- where as other endpoints are of getting blogs, comments, queries and likes
# What I learned
- Setting up  a node server
- Creating and setting up an endpoint using MVC approach
- Using Jest, supertest frameworks to test my APIs
- protecting endpoints using passport.js middleware to authenticate and jwt tokens
- Using postman to test my API
- Also creating a culture of CI/CD using circle CI
- Using coveralls and circle ci to create a badge
- using Swagger to document my API.
